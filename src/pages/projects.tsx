              As the UI/UX Designer at OneStaff Medical, 
              I created a complete overhaul of their website, both internally and externally.
              By leveraging modern design principles and in depth user research, 
              I designed and built many user experience enhancing features such as a fully mobile friendly website 
              and a consistent design system, resulting in heightened user engagement and an enhanced overall experience.

              This website was built for a local client that boards 
              and trains dogs. As they embarked on their online journey, 
              they entrusted me with the task of not only establishing 
              their web presence but also revitalizing their entire 
              brand identity. This dynamic website seamlessly integrates 
              engaging YouTube videos, offering valuable insights into their services. 
              Additionally, a user-friendly contact form allows prospective clients 
              to effortlessly reach out and inquire about the services they provide.

              This Figma file features a brand guide and prototype for a fictitious 
              travel company named Escapay. It covers the companyâ€™s entire identity 
              including their logo, fonts, color pallet, and images.
              The prototype highlights the different locations that users can scroll 
              through and save to their favorites list. They can then view their 
              favorite list and explore and compare the locations they wish to visit.
